I share my homework in the form of questions and answers.
You can see the answer on codeforc file.
Question is:

According to the number of days (minimum 1, maximum 30) entered on the keyboard and the temperature values ​​of the days; Find the first value that will make the total temperature zero (0) when it is multiplied by -1 and write the C program that displays it on the screen. If the number of days entered from the keyboard is outside of the limit values, the program should warn the user and ask for re-entry.

In the program, there must be a function called Find the reset. According to the number of days sent and the temperature values ​​of the days; Returns the sequence number of the first value that resets the sum when multiplied by -1. If there is no such value, it returns -1. Do not forget to use a prototype. 

CASE STUDY 1:  
Enter the number of days (min 1 - max 30): 35
Error!! Re-enter the number of days (min 1 - max 30): 55
Error!! Re-enter the number of days (min 1 - max 30): 5
Enter the temperature for 5 days: 1 3 -5 4 3
-------------------------------------------------- -------- 
The first value that resets the sum of temperature when multiplied by -1 is in the 2nd row.
CASE STUDY 2:
Enter the number of days (min 1 - max 30): 4
Enter the temperature for 4 days: 1 2 4 8
-------------------------------------------------- -------- 
There is no value to reset the sum of temperature when multiplied by -1.
